If you want to place out of 506 and into 507 (or, for BSI students who didn't take 106, if you want to check whether you're ready to take 206), follow the instructions in the .py file. You'll want to edit the file and then submit your revised file.

BSI students with questions, including requests for clarification of the assignment or help with debugging problems, can email bsi-206-prep@umich.edu

MSI and MHI students with questions, including requests for clarification of the assignment or help with debugging problems, can email umsi506-waiver-help@umich.edu

Submit your solution set as an attached .py file to one of those two email addresses.
